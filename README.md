# tiko - DevOps task

This task tries to cover mixed levels of experience in 6 different areas and simulates our daily activies.
With this task you can have an idea about what we are doing and some challenges that you will face.

&nbsp;
# Knowledge Coverage
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting
- Programming

&nbsp;
# Your Environment Requirements
- Docker
```
We ask only for Docker because all tools will be wrapped inside a container - this is how we will review your solution
```

&nbsp;
# How to Start
We have split the task into 3 big sections `k8s`, `programming` and `terraform`, all of them have their own README&#46;md to guide you. There are no dependencies between each section, so it's your decision where to start.

# Notes

After receiving this task we ask you to send back a first version of your solution in `1 hour`. If you need and want to spend more time, just tell us that you intend to send an updated version later.

The task is a little broad and we don't expect that you fully complete it. So please add as many comments as you want 
to explain what would you do to solve the missing parts.

In case the task description is not clear or if you are stuck somewhere please
contact us any time! We value collaboration and asking questions.

Doing partially the sections in `Knowledge Coverage` is much better than doing 100% of a single section.
Remember, the goal is for you to show us your experience and problem solving!

See you soon in the next phase!
